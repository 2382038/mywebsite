                    Hello, my name is <b>Aimee Kayla Miracle Simbolon</b>, i want tell you about my holiday during the summer break.
                    This past summer, my sister Angie and I went to visit our family in the <i>United States</i>. 
                    While we were there, I spent a lot of time with my uncle, aunt, and cousins. 
                    I also got to meet up with some of my friends and relatives who have already settled in the USA.
                    When I landed at LAX, aside from being nervous about the immigration, I was also worried about the time difference.
                    I was afraid it would take me a while to adjust, but surprisingly, I adapted quickly. I only experienced jet lag for two days.
                    On the first day, I rested, and the next morning, my uncle took me hiking, which helped me adjust, so after those two days, I was back on track.

                    During the holiday, I did many activities, including visiting various famous tourist spots like the Hollywood Sign, Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, and more. 
                    The first week was filled with excitement. I was not only reunited with my close family but also met my aunties family who had already settled there.
                    We spent almost a week together in San Diego, staying together, eating together, and having a great time.
                    I also made many new friends at church, who were very welcoming and made me feel at home. During my time in America, I was thrilled to achieve two of my dreams:
                    visiting Disneyland and attending a concert by either the Heritage Singers, Gaither, or The Collingsworth Family.
                    Just two days before I returned home, I had the incredible opportunity to attend a Heritage Singers concert.
                    I am so grateful for the chance to vacation in the USA last summer.

                    However, at the beginning of August, I had to return to Indonesia to continue my studies.
                    I had to attend campus orientation and then register for the new semester. 
                    In the end, I had a fantastic holiday, gaining many new experiences and enjoying my time with loved ones.
